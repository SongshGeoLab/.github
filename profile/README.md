## 🏛️ About Us

Welcome to the **SongshGeo Lab** - an interdisciplinary research group led by [Dr. Shuang Song (宋爽)](https://cv.songshgeo.com/), based at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology. Our team bridges computational modeling, geographical analysis, and historical insights to understand complex social-ecological systems.

We focus on the **co-evolution of human society and natural environment**, using water as a critical lens to explore:
- Long-term evolution of water management systems (irrigation, flood control, water supply)
- Social-hydrological dynamics in large river basins
- Agent-based modeling of real-world social-ecological systems
- Historical geography and institutional analysis

## 🔬 Research Focus

Our interdisciplinary approach combines:

- **🌊 Social-Hydrology**: Understanding water-society interactions across temporal and spatial scales
- **🤖 Agent-Based Modeling**: Developing computational frameworks to simulate complex human-nature systems
- **🗺️ Spatial Analysis**: Leveraging GIS and remote sensing for geographical insights
- **📜 Historical Geography**: Integrating long-term historical perspectives into contemporary challenges
- **🏛️ Institutional Analysis**: Examining governance structures and collective decision-making

**Current Focus**: Yellow River Basin, China - one of the world's most anthropogenically altered large river systems

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [ABSESpy](https://github.com/SongshGeo/ABSESpy)
**Agent-Based Social-Ecological Systems Modeling Framework in Python**

A powerful open-source framework that makes it easier to build artificial social-ecological systems with real geospatial datasets and fully incorporate human behavior.

### Yellow River Basin Project
**Social-Ecological System Analysis** and [its visualization](http://dt.songshgeo.com/).

Coupling human and natural system studies to support sustainability in one of the world's most complex river systems. Checkout [my publications](https://cv.songshgeo.com/publication/) on this topic.

### [PaperBell](https://paperbell.cn/)
**Academic Note-Taking Workflow**

An Obsidian-based workflow designed for researchers to manage academic literature and knowledge. This is a non-academic project, and I am the founder. We are recruiting new members, please get in touch if you are interested in workflow, knowledge management, and research coordination.
